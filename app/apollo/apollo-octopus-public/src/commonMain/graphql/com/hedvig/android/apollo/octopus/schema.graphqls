A 'Member' is the central user-like concept of our platform, referring to someone who has bought insurance
with Hedvig and is now as we call is a "member".
The Member type in our schema must always refer to the member based on the current authentication, i.e. the
subject in the bearer token of the Authorization header.
This type must never be used in an unauthenticated context, and it must always refer to the member in the
authorization header. This is usually done either by:
- Returning it from `Query.currentMember`
- or from a mutation with return type `MemberMutationOutput`, which will refer to the authenticated member.
This is federated across multiple subgraphs, which enables us to attach data to it that "belongs to the
currently authenticated member", such as your "active contracts" etc. These could have just as easily been placed
at the top level like `Query.activeContracts`, respecting the current authentication, but placing them under
`Member` gives a more intuitive model when interacting with it from the outside perspective.
