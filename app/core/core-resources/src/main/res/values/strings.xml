  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_01">The insurance covers your spouse or partner and children – as long as they are added to your policy. You can easily add and remove co-insured [here](https://hedvig.page.link/insurances).\n\nThe co-insured is covered by the same conditions as the policyholder. In most cases, the price of the policy will be higher when you add co-insured, as it covers more people.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_02">If you want to know more about your insurance with Hedvig, you can find your insurance conditions and your insurance letter [here](https://hedvig.page.link/insurances).\n\nIf you want to read more about any other insurance or purchase another one, you can easily do so here:\n[Home Insurance](https://www.hedvig.com/se-en/insurances/home-insurance)\n[Car Insurance](https://www.hedvig.com/se-en/insurances/car-insurance)\n[Pet Insurance](https://www.hedvig.com/se-en/insurances/pet-insurance)\n[Accident Insurance](https://www.hedvig.com/se-en/insurances/accident)</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_03">If an incident has occurred, it is crucial to promptly report the claim to us. This enables us to assess the situation, align it with the terms and conditions of your insurance, and determine eligibility for compensation. In some cases we may need to ask more questions to help you further.\n\nMake a claim [here](https://hedvig.page.link/home).</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_25">Yes, for insurances signed or renewed after January 8, 2025, you can increase your base deductible at any time, as long as you don\'t already have the highest deductible level. Go to [your insurances](https://hedvig.page.link/insurances) and choose ‘Edit your insurance’.\n\nThe deductible level can affect your monthly premium. Choosing a higher deductible can lower your monthly premium, while a lower deductible can increase it.</string>

  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_01">Monthly payments are made by digital direct debit via our partner Trustly. If you have not already connected your direct debit, you can easily do so [here](https://hedvig.page.link/payments). To link your direct debit, you need a Swedish personal number and a mobile BankId. It can take up to 1-3 banking days to approve your linked bankgiro. You can see it in the app as soon as it is approved.</string>
  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_02">As the withdrawal is made at the end of each month, this means that money can be withdrawn even if the insurance policy is terminated. You only pay for the days that the policy has been active. \n\nExample: Your policy was terminated on June 15. On June 27, the last payment is deducted for the days in June that the policy was active. You only pay for the period between June 1 and 15.</string>
  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_03">To connect your payment you need a mobile BankID. Digital direct debit is easily connected via the Hedvig app, not through your bank.  \n\nIf you cannot connect your direct debit via the Hedvig app, it may be that your bank has a block on digital direct debit. Contact your bank for more information. Are you still having problems connecting your payments? Send us a message here in the app.</string>

  <string name="SUBMIT_CLAIM_EMERGENCY_FAQ2_LABEL">Yes, your home insurance travel coverage has a base deductible. The amount of your deductible is stated in your insurance letter.\nThe deductible is the portion of the claim amount that you must pay yourself for each claim. If your claim costs are lower than the deductible, the insurance cannot cover them. If your claim costs exceed the deductible, the insurance can cover the amount above the deductible, and Hedvig has the right to reclaim the deductible from you if necessary.</string>

  <string name="SUBMIT_CLAIM_EMERGENCY_FAQ5_LABEL">If it is an unexpected and sudden change in your health condition or an accident for which you need medical attention, it is generally considered acute. To provide a more accurate response, we need to examine your particular claim.</string>

  <string name="SUBMIT_CLAIM_EMERGENCY_FAQ6_TITLE">I cannot fly home as planned, what do I do?</string>
  <string name="SUBMIT_CLAIM_EMERGENCY_FAQ7_LABEL">If you do not have our add-on, Travel Insurance Plus, your home insurance will not cover specific activities, excursions, or costs that you were unable to use.\n\nHowever, if you have Travel Insurance Plus as an add-on to your home insurance, you are entitled to compensation for unused activity trips and event costs that you were unable to attend due to a doctor\'s orders.\n\nIf you have been hospitalized, prescribed indoor bed rest by a doctor at your travel destination, or need to return home early (requires prior approval from SOS International or Hedvig), you are entitled to a fixed compensation of 500 SEK per day for unused travel costs. With Travel Protection Plus, this compensation increases to 1,200 – 2,000 SEK per day.</string>
  <string name="SUBMIT_CLAIM_EMERGENCY_FAQ7_TITLE">I will miss a prebooked activity due to my illness. Is that covered?</string>
  <string name="SUBMIT_CLAIM_EMERGENCY_FAQ8_LABEL">If you have the Travel Protection Plus add-on as a complement to your home insurance, you can receive compensation for a new trip, up to a maximum of 50 000 kr. This applies if you or your travel companion become acutely ill or suffer an accidental injury and are hospitalized or prescribed bed rest indoors at the destination.\n\nThe condition is that the hospital stay or prescribed bed rest exceeds more than half the number of the total travel days, and you must be able to provide a certificate from a qualified doctor at the destination or through a doctor via Hedvig Global Assistance (SOS International).
