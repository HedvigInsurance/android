The certificate confirms that you are covered by insurance in case something happens to you, which may be necessary in some countries.\n\nDo you need additional coverage for your next trip? With Travel Insurance Plus, you can receive compensation for things like missed activities, delayed luggage, cancellation protection, rental car deductible reduction, and much more. You can also choose whether Travel Insurance Plus should apply for 45 or 60 days. Read more and sign Travel Plus [here](hedvig.page.link/travel-addon).</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_08">If the injury occurred during the insurance period and fulfils the criteria to be classified as an accidental injury (bodily injury, involuntary, of sudden external violence/external event and having required medical attention), we can help with compensation for permanent scars based on the scar table. The assessment is usually made 12 months after the wound occurred.\n\nRead more about your accident insurance [here](https://hedvig.page.link/insurances).</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_09">Unfortunately, accident insurance does not cover sick leave or loss of income. However, if you have lost your ability to work by at least 50\u0025 due to an accidental injury that is so severe that you cannot work to the same extent as if you had before the injury, the insurance can help with compensation for so-called economic disability.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_10">If you or a family member has an accident, Hedvig can compensate you for, among other things, hospitalisation, rehabilitation, therapy and dental injuries. The insurance also protects you if you suffer permanent disability or reduced working capacity as a result of an accident.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_11">Read about the fixed deductible [here](https://hedvig.com/se-en/insurances/pet-insurance)</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_12">Hedvig offers three different levels of cat and dog insurance, with deductibles of 0 kr, 2 500 kr or 3 500 kr. In addition to the fixed deductible, you have a variable deductible of 15-25 \u0025 of the cost of treatment. You only pay the fixed deductible once per insurance year (12 months), regardless of the number of vet visits.\n\nOur deductibles:\nBasic: 0 kr or 3 500 kr fixed + 25 \u0025 variable\nStandard: 0 kr or 2 500 kr fixed + 25 \u0025 variable\nPremium: 0 kr or 2 500 kr fixed + 15 \u0025 variable\n\nYour fixed deductible will always be 1 000 kr lower than shown above if you first book a digital appointment with FirstVet and are referred to a clinic. You can book unlimited calls with FirstVet at no extra cost.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_13">The monthly premium is usually lower if your animal is neutered, as the risk of contracting certain diseases is reduced. If you have neutered your animal after signing up for Hedvig, please contact us.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_14">If there is a specific cost or treatment you are considering, we recommend that you contact your veterinarian and ask for a preliminary decision. The vet will then submit the necessary information to us, and we can give a definitive answer regarding your coverage and reimbursement.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_15">FirstVet is a digital veterinary clinic where you can get advice from licensed veterinarians. The service is included in our pet insurance and you have unlimited access to veterinary calls at FirstVet at no extra cost.\n\nPlease register Hedvig as your insurance company with FirstVe.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_16"> </string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_17">Traffic insurance is mandatory by law as long as the car is used. It is your responsibility as the owner to ensure that the car has a valid Traffic insurance policy. If the car does not have Traffic insurance, you will have to pay high fees to the Swedish Motor Insurances. You do not need an insurance if the car is cancelled at temporary deregistered.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_18">In general, you are not allowed to drive a car that has been temporarily deregistered.\n\nHowever, the Swedish Transport Agency has made exceptions for a journey that is the shortest suitable route to or from the nearest inspection. In this case, the car must be insured against accidents and there must be no unpaid vehicle taxes. You are also not allowed to tow a car that is parked. You can read more on the Swedish Transport Agency\'s website [here](https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/).</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_19">A green card serves as proof that your car has the compulsory traffic insurance required to drive both in Sweden and abroad. Some countries require you to show a green card when driving in the country.\n\nIn most European countries, you do not need a special insurance certificate. However, when driving abroad, you should bring your car registration certificate and your insurance policy, which you can find here in the app under the Insurance tab.\n\nCountries with green card requirements (see an updated list on tff.se):\n\n* Albania\n* Azerbaijan\n* Iran\n* Morocco\n* Moldova\n* North Macedonia\n* Tunisia\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n\nContact us in the Hedvig app if you need a green card. The card will be sent to you by post.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_20">Hedvig\'s car insurance is available as traffic insurance, partial insurance and full insurance.\n\nTraffic insurance is required by Swedish law. It covers all personal injury and property damage caused by the car. For example, if you damage another car, your traffic insurance will cover the damage to the other car. \n\nTo get help with damage to your car, you will also need to take out partial or full insurance. Partial insurance includes traffic insurance, but also theft, fire, glass, machinery, rescue and legal protection insurance. Full insurance covers the same as our partial insurance, including traffic insurance, and also includes vehicle damage insurance. \n\nIf you have a newer car with a vehicle damage guarantee, partial insurance is usually enough to get the same coverage as full insurance.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_21">If you have misfuelled, do not start the car and contact a workshop immediately to reduce the risk of major damage to the car and engine. Unfortunately, misfuelling is not covered by Hedvig\'s car insurance.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_22">You can switch at any time between traffic, partial and full insurance. The easiest way is to contact us directly here in the app, and we will help you.</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_23">Yes! You can always choose a more comprehensive coverage, as long as you don’t already have the maximum protection, or select a higher deductible amount to lower your monthly premium. Click [here](https://hedvig.page.link/change-tier) to update your insurance coverage. \n\nIf you need additional travel protection, you can also add our Travel Plus coverage to your home insurance [here](https://hedvig.page.link/travel-addon).\n</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_24">Yes! Since January 8, 2025, ID theft coverage is included in our Home and House insurance with the Standard and Max coverage levels. If you are currently on the Bas coverage level, you can upgrade to Standard or Max [here](https://hedvig.page.link/change-tier).</string>
  <string name="HC_COVERAGE_A_25">Yes, for insurances signed or renewed after January 8, 2025, you can increase your base deductible at any time, as long as you don\'t already have the highest deductible level. Go to [your insurances](https://hedvig.page.link/insurances) and choose ‘Edit your insurance’.\n\nThe deductible level can affect your monthly premium. Choosing a higher deductible can lower your monthly premium, while a lower deductible can increase it.</string>

If you have not already connected your direct debit, you can easily do so [here](https://hedvig.page.link/payments). To link your direct debit, you need a Swedish personal number and a mobile BankId. It can take up to 1-3 banking days to approve your linked bankgiro. You can see it in the app as soon as it is approved.</string>
  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_02">As the withdrawal is made at the end of each month, this means that money can be withdrawn even if the insurance policy is terminated. You only pay for the days that the policy has been active. \n\nExample: Your policy was terminated on June 15. On June 27, the last payment is deducted for the days in June that the policy was active. You only pay for the period between June 1 and 15.</string>
  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_03">To connect your payment you need a mobile BankID. Digital direct debit is easily connected via the Hedvig app, not through your bank.  \n\nIf you cannot connect your direct debit via the Hedvig app, it may be that your bank has a block on digital direct debit.

  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_06">You can easily access all the details of your payments [here](https://hedvig.page.link/payments). If we have or will charge more than your expected monthly price, it may be due to one of the following:\n* You\'ve added a policy or made a change to your existing policy, such as adding a co-insured person or moving into a larger home.\n* Your discount code has expired during a current month, so the amount has been adjusted on the next payment.\n* Your insurance policy is renewed after one year and it is common for the price to increase. Renewals are always notified in advance.\n* You have a missed payment, which will be included in the next payment. This can happen if you are a new member and you sign a digital direct debit close to the first payment (on the 27th) and the connection has not yet gone through.</string>
  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_07">You can easily see all the details of your payment [here](https://hedvig.page.link/payments).

  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_09">Your price may have changed due to the renewal of your policy. This happens once a year and it is common for the price to be adjusted.

Our aim is always to set prices that are as fair and accurate as possible.\n\nIf your price has changed during a current policy year, it may be because you have added, removed or changed something in your policies. It could also be because a time-limited discount has expired.</string>
  <string name="HC_PAYMENTS_A_10">Make sure your digital direct debit is connected. You can do this easily [here](https://hedvig.page.link/payments).

Make sure that you have the enough balance on the 27th of every month to cover each payment. Three additional attempts will be made in the following weekdays.\n* If you are a new member and have signed a digital direct debit close to the first payment (on the 27th), the connection may not yet have gone through.
